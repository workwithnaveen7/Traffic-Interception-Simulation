# Traffic Interception Simulation: A Cybersecurity Awareness Tool

## Overview
The **Traffic Interception Simulation** is an educational web application aimed at raising awareness about cybersecurity threats related to data interception. This interactive tool demonstrates how the absence of protective measures, like VPNs and HTTPS, can expose sensitive data to attackers, especially in public or unsecured networks.

## Purpose
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, understanding the risks associated with data transmission is crucial. This simulation helps users visualize:
- The importance of using VPNs and HTTPS to safeguard their information.
- How easily data can be intercepted in vulnerable environments, such as public Wi-Fi networks.

## Features
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can toggle options for VPN and HTTPS, allowing them to see the impact of these protections on data security.
- **Visual Simulation**: A graphical representation of data packets moving between a source and destination, highlighting potential interception by an attacker.
- **Detailed Logs**: An interception log that records the results of each simulation, providing insights into whether the data was secure or compromised.
